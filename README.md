ReverseGear — stop being forced back to 1st when you reverse

ReverseGear is a small Farming Simulator 25 mod that overrides the game's default behaviour of snapping your transmission back to 1st gear every time you shift into reverse. With this mod enabled you keep a sensible gear selection when you reverse so you don't have to skip through many gears to get a decent reverse speed.

## Key features

- Prevents the transmission from forcing 1st gear when selecting reverse
- Restores the previous appropriate gear (or keeps the current gear) for smoother reversing
- Plug-and-play: no in-game configuration required

## Why this mod

By default FS25 resets (or forces) transmission to 1st gear when you switch into reverse. That behaviour is frustrating on tractors and vehicles where you need a higher reverse speed and forces you to cycle through many gears to get back to a usable reverse ratio. This mod keeps your gear selection sensible so reversing is immediate and predictable.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/alefranz/ReverseGear_FS25/releases) page.
1. Place the ZIP file into your Farming Simulator 25 mods folder. On Windows this is usually under your Documents folder for the game, for example:

   ```powershell
   %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\mods
   ```

1. Launch the game and enable the mod from the Mods menu.

## Usage

No special controls are required. With the mod enabled your vehicle will no longer be forced into 1st gear when selecting reverse. Use your normal gear controls and the transmission will retain the previous gear.

## Compatibility & Notes

- Target game: Farming Simulator 25 (FS25).
- This mod modifies transmission behaviour. It should be compatible with most vehicles, but gearbox-specific or other transmission-modifying mods may conflict.
- Multiplayer: this mod should work in multiplayer, but it will only restore the previous gear for the user.

## Troubleshooting

- If the mod doesn't appear in-game, make sure the ZIP is placed directly inside the `mods` folder.
- If behaviors isn't changed, check the game's `log.txt` for errors related to the mod. Remove other transmission or gearbox mods to check for conflicts.
